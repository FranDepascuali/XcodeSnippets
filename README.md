## XcodeSnippets ##

These are common [code snippets](http://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/) that I use for developing on iOS. Feel free to contribute or use them, they should save some time.

### Boostrap ###
```
1. Clone the project
2. run addSnipets.sh. It will copy (without overwriting) the snippets to your xcode snippets folder.
```

### Usage ###

I decided to prefix the snippets with "_". Therefore, it is easier to differentiate them from xcode built-in snippets.

You can either:
```
1. Drag the snippets from xcode snippets.
2. Write "_" and xcode will autocomplete. (Recommended)
```

### Example ###
